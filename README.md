# CS50 Public Repository

All code is from [CS50x 2023](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) however this is a private repository, thus, the need for this repository to show my code and solutions.

# Important note:
When viewing my code, you may see unfamiliar things that are not there in the language "C". This is because CS50 requires users to use their **codespace** ([CS50 Codespace](https://cs50.dev/)) which allows you to use include the header file/library called **"cs50.h"**  ([CS50 library](https://manual.cs50.io/)) which has built in data types and functions. So, if you see unfamiliar keywords, datatypes, or functions such as **"string"**, **"get_int()"** etc, this is why!
# How to run my code
1. Copy and paste my code
2. Go to  ([CS50 Codespace](https://cs50.dev/)) and login with Github
3. Create a file using the GUI or go to the terminal and type `code [file name here].c` 
4. *Note:* **file name cannot have white space**
5. Once my code is inside the file, go to the terminal and type `make [file name here]`
6. Finally, to run the code, type `./[file name here]`
